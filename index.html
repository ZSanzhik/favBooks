<center><h1>My favorite books</h1> </center>

<p> Books for me are not just pages stuck together. This is the world I am plunging into with every turn of the page. Each book is a new adventure, a new story, new heroes.

I find inspiration, wisdom and understanding in the world of books. Each author has left a piece of himself in his work, and by opening the pages, I become a part of his world, his thinking, his imagination.

Through books, I learn to see the world through the eyes of others, understand different points of view and experience emotions that I might not experience in everyday life. Books expand my horizons and help me become a more conscious person.

I love the atmosphere of comfort and tranquility that reading a book brings me in a cozy armchair or a cozy corner. This is the time when I am alone with myself, my own thoughts and the world created in the author's mind.

Each book is a new opportunity to live several lives, go through many trials, experience joys and sorrows. I am grateful to these paper friends for the world they open to me and for the wealth of experience they bring into my life.

Books are an integral part of my world, and I will continue to discover new pages and new stories, because in each book I find something special that makes my life richer and brighter.</p>

    <center><h3><p> One Hundred Years of Solitude by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_García_Márquez">Gabriel Garcia Marquez</a></p></h3> </center>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="text">
      <p>One of the 20th century's enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize–winning career. The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility — the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth — these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, andpurity that are the mark of a master. Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race..</p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="text">
      <p>The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime, for example the Jewish mafia. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it, a kind of decadence.</p>
